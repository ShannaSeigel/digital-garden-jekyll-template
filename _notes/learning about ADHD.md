title: Learning about ADHD
---

Nov. 2021: Started a more in-depth look at what ADHD is and if any of that applies to me. This is something that's been on my mind for the last few years, mainly because of overly-relatable Tumblr posts. 

Starting with CHADD and their $20 course on [ADHD in Adults](https://chadd.org/adult-to-adult/).

I did some reading about a year or so ago about the "inattentive" subtype and asked my psychiatrist for an evaluation but I don't think it was very thorough.
