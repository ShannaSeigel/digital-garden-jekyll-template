Nov-12-2021 Learning website stuffs once again

🆀 why do i go through this cycle like every fall where i want to make a personal website and digital garden and then it fails and i forget for a year? been renewing my domain for years and have yet to have a product i like AND is mostly working

🅰️ Attention deficit?


so im starting over once again, looked briefly at some digital garden things and saw this one now has some info regarding obsidian. not sure how this will all work. feels like you have to be very intentional about which notes are where. feels like its buried too deep in a folder tree but i know i can open it as its own vault. but then i still have my own folders and notes for just me.
