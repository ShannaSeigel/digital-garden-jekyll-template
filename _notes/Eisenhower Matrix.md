The Eisenhower Matrix helps break down tasks by urgency and importance. You end up with a box that has four cross sections, but how people fill in those cross sections varies.

*several diagrams included example tasks but i dont care to list them*

## Summary

|                   | Urgent                                                                                                       | Not Urgent           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| **Important**     | - Do. Now.<br> - Priority task<br>- Deadlines, catastrophes <br>- Fires to put out (hopefully not literally) | - Schedule for later<br>- Decide/Plan when to handle<br>- Something that adds value to your life |
| **Not Important** | - Delegate<br> - Postpone <br> - Is this adding value to your life?                                          | - Skip it.<br>- No value<br>- Waste of time/busy work                   |
