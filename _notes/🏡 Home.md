# Where My Brain Goes (WMBG)

**WMBG** is what I named by Obsidian vault sometime in 2020. I had "digital brain" (turns out that's rather popular) and others but the goal is just to follow what seems interesting to me in the moment. ***Off we go!***

What we'll find here is my home note or landing page for exploring my personal knowledge base. Like many other note makers before me, some of these notes will only make sense to me and some links may go into files I haven't shared publicly. Feel free to poke around and sorry if you hit any dead-ends.

## Status November 14, 2021 
For now, I just have my [[ðŸª´ Garden Scraps ðŸª´]] page to share. Evnetually I'll move other files over here. As much as I'd prefer to keep all my files in one place, I have to have a folder somewhere as my GitHub repository. I started with an empty folder and I'll try to fill it up.
