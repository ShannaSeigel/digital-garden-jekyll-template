Index of stuff on my mind. Not really a note, more than a bookmark, it's just some links and a few comments. A garden scrap if you will.

# ðŸª´ ~ ðŸª´ ~ ðŸª´

- Nov-29-2021: [[Plarn]]. That is all.
- Nov-27-2021: Working task management in obsidian and debating whether to include tags for an [[Eisenhower Matrix]], made a note to refresh on concept.
- [[Learning about ADHD]] because I've wondered for a few years if I have it. (Spoiler from 2022 me: You sure do have ADHD and the next few months are gonna be a lot)
- making a website from obsidian to github and more
	- [[ðŸ¤” online garden next steps]]
	- seems every fall, for the last few years, I end up looking at personal website options. Maybe this time will be more successful? ðŸ˜…
- getting organized / task management / personal data tracking
- [[markdown note test]], test formatting
