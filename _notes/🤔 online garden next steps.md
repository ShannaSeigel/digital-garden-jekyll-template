### Nov. ideas for online notes site
- consider favicon
- look over Max V files in my github repo folder
	- main page has a blog feed, so how does that get added?
		-  https://maximevaillancourt.com/
-  see old repo here for inspo: https://github.com/ShannaSeigel/digital-brain
	-  cname
	- anything i want to edit like 404, other pages?
-  another page attempt with some notes i was testing: https://github.com/ShannaSeigel/slipbox
-  maybe contact people that starred my other repos with new one? otherwise might delete or make something private that someone used for a reference
-  review tags on other projects and copy over
-  consider template for notes vault to auto include basic frontmatter
- dark mode toggle?
- consider small font or color changes from original template?
- add a search bar? or not needed since i can look in obsidian?
