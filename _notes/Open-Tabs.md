!! more of a journal/stream of thought, doesnt really go online
- move this to bigger vault?

I always have dozens of ideas floating around and they just wind up as hundreds of open tabs in my browser. Like for real, 450 tabs on laptop, >100 on my phone or tablet... it's too much. Sometimes I think I want to create new notes, new knowledge but really the idea is so early that it's just a list of links. Maybe I can save them here as "open tabs" or "garden scraps."

Why not just use bookmarks? Why not indeed. I have no good reason really other than I think this might be more aesthetically pleasing. I've tried so many bookmarking platforms, built-in options, drafts, sending stuff to my email or task manager. It's a fucking mess. And I end up researching the same things over and over because it's not consistent.

Now, managing bookmarks manually is kind of dumb. It would be way easier to use just about anything else and some tags maybe. Which i'm trying to do with dynalist. i guess this is more of a step beyond. its a waste of time to just c/p URLs but if I've spent *some* time with the material, then i guess it goes here

i think i just reinvented my way to other people's "seed" notes 
fucking hell
well whatever. seed, scrap, tab, it's less than a note, more than a bookmark, its kind of just a reference with a few thoughts. which is great in obsidian. im not sure i want all of those to exist online though. so within this repository, do i just migrate everything to make for easy linking? i'd rather work in the vault above so i can edit other pages and such. i guess i just pop into this one specifically for scraps.
