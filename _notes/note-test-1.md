Hello to you! Did you come from [[note-test-2]]?
linkys, why don't some of them work for me? these are pages that used to work?
- [[note-test-1]]
- [[stuff ta learn]]
- [[your-frontmatter-text]]
- [[Open Tabs]]
- [[note-test-3]]



I've added some text here and I'm testing my breadcrumb links. I was adding these to all my notes but I'm wondering if it will be redundant with the digital garden template.
