## Shanna is putting text here. For Reasons™️


I'll add more some other time. For now (Nov. 2021), I'll say this:


- I'm a mid-30s, American womxn


- My professional role is genetic counseling for hereditary cancer conditions. This means I talk to people about cancers that run in families and what to do about it.


- I've had various digital spaces over the years, the first in **1999**, when I was but a wee babe and thought I would be a world-famous teen author (as in, I would be a teenager with published works). It was called "Ya Think!?" under my made up company "Imagine Ink." Yup. 😅
	- (I should lower the cringe level, I actually ran that site as a platform for young writers until I got to college and I got lots of submissions over those years)




- I considered calling my digital garden "Open Tabs" because the (no joke) 500+ tabs I typically have open between my computer, tablet, and phone kind of reflect what I've been thinking about over time.
