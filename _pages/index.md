# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Shanna

<p style="padding: 2em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 12px;">
I'm trying out a digital garden once again as I try to get myself organized and figure out my PKM. Welcome! I'll try to update this page to be more useful in the future. 
</p>

Lately I've had the desire to share my [[ðŸª´ Garden Scraps ðŸª´|garden scraps]] or little bits of notes. I always want what I put into the world to be perfect and polished, which means nothing ever turns up. Instead I'll just see what happens when I follow where my brain goes and what I learn along the way.
<br>

Each note includes the graph of the full website, which you can also see [[graph|here]].

*Like the look? I'm testing out the digital garden template from [Max Vaillancourt.](https://twitter.com/vaillancourtmax)*
