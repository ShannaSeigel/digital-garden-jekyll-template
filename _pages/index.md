# 👋 Hey, I'm Shanna

<p style="padding: 2em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 12px;">
Welcome! I'm trying out a digital garden once again as I try to get myself organized and figure out my PKM. —Shanna Nov-18-2021

Lately I've had the desire to share my [[🪴 Garden Scraps 🪴|garden scraps]] or little bits of notes. I always want what I put into the world to be perfect and polished, which means nothing actually gets shared. Instead I'll just see what happens when I follow [[🏡 Home|where my brain goes]] and what I learn along the way.
<br>

Each note includes the graph of the full website, which you can also see [[graph|here]].
