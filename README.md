# shanna.fyi

A space for my online notes, digital garden, knowledge management system, or any other labels we want to throw in here. My goal is to have a space to share some of my notes as well as some features of a personal website (maybe a blog? Online CV? We'll see).

[I'm using the digital garden template from Maxime Vaillancourt](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template)
